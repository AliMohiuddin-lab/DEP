House Price Analysis and Prediction
This project involved analyzing real estate data and applying advanced machine learning techniques to predict property prices.

ðŸ“ŒProject Highlights:
- Data Exploration: Thorough analysis to uncover key insights from the data.
- Feature Engineering: Creation of relevant features to enhance model performance.
- Outlier Analysis: Identification and handling of outliers to improve model accuracy.
- Model Evaluation: Implementation and evaluation of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- Future Price Predictions: Prediction of future house prices based on hypothetical scenarios.

Model Performance:ðŸ“Š
- Linear Regression: MAE - 7,124,822, R2- 0.246 
- Random Forest: MAE - 4,124,486, R2 - 0.593 
- Gradient Boosting: MAE - 5,580,709, R2- 0.491

This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, outliers analysis, model training, and evaluation, and I'm thrilled to have gained such practical knowledge.
